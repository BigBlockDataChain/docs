Cytoscape
Website: http://js.cytoscape.org/
Features: compound nodes, directed edges, curved edges, different layouts(for the graph), multiple graph instances
Downsides: only has node graph abilities (create edges and nodes), unlike D3 where can make bar, line graphs, maps, etc

WebCola
Website: https://ialab.it.monash.edu/webcola/
Features: very similar to cytoscape, can make 3d graphs
Downsides: less scalable to very large graphs}
